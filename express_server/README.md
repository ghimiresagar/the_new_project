# Express Server part

Need to install package before starting.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.
Change from 3000 to 9000 under bin/www file so there's no error with react.

The page wont reload if you make edits automatically.<br />
If automatic reload required, install nodemon and run nodemon inside directory.
